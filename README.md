VRGA-Object-Loader
==================

Virtual Reality, Graphics and Animation assignment: implement a Wavefront .OBJ loader using SDL2 and OpenGL 3.2 (relying on vertex buffer objects) in C++11.

<h1>Requirements</h1>

Use OpenGL Vertex buffer objects and OpenGL 3.2. The use of fixed pipeline opengl instruction (glVertex, etc.) is not allowed.

Use SDL2 to create you window and handle windowing events

Use glm to do your computations

<h2>Loading the mesh</h2>
You should be able to load (and display) a basic mesh given as an argument to the application (including only triangular faces).

<h2>Windowing</h2>
Add the ability to re-size and close window, and load files by drag and drop

<h2>Navigation</h2>
Implement an intuitive navigation via keyboard and mouse, including zooming.

<h2>Lighting</h2>
Introduce several light sources.

<h2>Shading models</h2>
Implement various shading models using shaders, and enable toggling between them.

<h2>Coding style</h2>
Adhere to the google styleguide in coding.

<h2>Attribution</h2>
Feel free to take ideas from other places, but please attribute them in the manual.

<h1>Extras</h1>
Fog, Particles, Texture, Animation, full OBJ compatibility
